This code snippet exports a function named register that is an asynchronous function. It takes in two parameters, req and res, which represent the request and response objects in an Express.js application.Inside the function, there are two comments indicating that there should be validation of the data before creating a user and creating a user in the database. However, the actual implementation of these tasks is missing from the code snippet.Finally, the function sends the string 'auth' as the response using the res.send() method.
